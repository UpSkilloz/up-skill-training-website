Post-training, we conduct a detailed assessment to measure the results and participant satisfaction. With the information gathered in the initial meeting, we identify specific KPIs and desired behavioural changes you wish to see in your sales team. The post-training assessment will confirm the success of the sales training quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrating its effectiveness and your return on investment.
